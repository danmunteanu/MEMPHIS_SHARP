## Overview

**MemphisSharp** is a tool to help renaming mp3 files in a visual way.

The basic idea is this: 
- **Add a folder** with music files (mp3 only for now)
- **Click on a file** from the list on the left
- The file name is broken down in **tokens**
- You can edit each *token* and *transform* it to your will

The neat part? The app supports a ***transforms*** engine to automate renaming multiple files at once.
Define and configure your transforms using the configurator the right hand side of the app.

***App is under (eternal?) development**.* 

And might never be ready. 

Why?

Well, this is a C# port of a previous app of mine, which I developed with C++ and Qt5, some time ago (2015-ish).

I'm not that motivated to fully develop it, since the idea is kinda old. I'm more interested in growing the underlying automation framework (RealityFrameworks).

This was a good exercise to stress-test said framework.

Alright, if you stumble upon this code and find it interesting, do what you want with it. No guarantees, though.
